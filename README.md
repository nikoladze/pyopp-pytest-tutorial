# pytest tutorial

Created for the [PYOPP workshop in Aachen 2025](https://indico.desy.de/event/43817).

To run the notebook you need to install (e.g. in a virtualenv) the packages from requirements.txt

With uv you can run jupyter in a temporary environment with necessary dependencies using

```bash
uv tool run --with-requirements requirements.txt jupyter lab
```
